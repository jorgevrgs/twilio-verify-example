# Twilio Verify Push Website Login

Twilio Verify Push is a multi-factor authentication method that requires the user to approve a transaction with an mobile application. This project demonstrates how to secure a login on a website. The user is granted access to the page after the sign up was approved with the app which has the Android or iOS Verify SDK embedded.

Twilio Verify Push SDK helps you adding multi-factor sdcurity with a low-friction and secure setup. This fully managed API service allows you to seamlessly verify users in-app via a secure channel.

This repository contains the website and the server backend written in NodeJS. For the mobile application please checkout the [Android Quickstart](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-verify-android) and [iOS Quickstart](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-verify-ios).
